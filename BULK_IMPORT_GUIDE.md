## üìù CSV Formatting Tips

### For Long Content

Wrap in double quotes and escape internal quotes:

```csv
"content","This is a long prompt that spans multiple lines.

It can include paragraphs.

And bullet points:
- Point 1
- Point 2"
```

### For Content with Quotes

Escape double quotes by doubling them:

```csv
"content","The prompt says ""Hello World"" as an example."
```

### For Formulas (if editing in Excel)

Prefix with a single quote to prevent Excel from evaluating:

```csv
"content","'Use this formula: =SUM(A1:A10)"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation (Adding to Navigation)

### Option 1: Direct URL

Share this URL with admins:
```
yoursite.com/?page=admin-bulk-import
```

### Option 2: Add to Settings Page

Edit `src/components/SettingsPage.tsx`:

```tsx
{isAdmin(user) && (
  <Button onClick={() => window.location.href = '/?page=admin-bulk-import'}>
    Bulk Import Prompts
  </Button>
)}
```

### Option 3: Add to Admin Menu

Create an admin-only navigation section in `Navigation.tsx`.

## üîí Security

- Only users in the admin list can access this feature
- All prompts are created under the admin's account
- Failed imports don't affect the database
- Validation happens before any database writes

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### "No valid prompts found"
- Check CSV format
- Ensure headers match template exactly
- Verify no empty rows

### "Missing required fields"
- Title, content, and category are required
- Check for typos in column names

### "Failed to import [prompt]"
- Check error message for specific issue
- Verify data types match expected format
- Ensure slug generation doesn't conflict

### Import succeeds but prompts don't appear
- Refresh the page
- Check visibility is set to "public"
- Verify you're on the Explore page

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with 2-3 prompts first
2. **Use Template**: Always start from the downloaded template
3. **Validate in Excel**: Fix any issues before uploading
4. **Backup**: Keep a copy of your CSV file
5. **Consistent Formatting**: Use similar structure across prompts
6. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on well-written, useful prompts
